== Bad comments is free for general use ==

Because there is a general need in the blogosphere for preventing malicious comments and spam, as much as possible, we've decided to make Bad comments free. After downloading the plugin, you can use it without a API key ( equals non power user - see [api key details](http://badcomments.chitic.eu/getkey/) ) or using the [free API key ](http://badcomments.chitic.eu/getkey/0/) ( equals 0 power user ). 

== Specific use ==

For more specific use of the plugin like daily update of old posts,  the ability of reading the malicious comments from the database to see what, where, when, why a user said something bad and most important to whom, you will need a more powerful [api key](http://badcomments.chitic.eu/getkey/). To get this kind of key, you will need to donate. All the donations are to support the coding team and to support the servers that are running the Bad coments database.
